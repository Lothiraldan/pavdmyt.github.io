My name is Pavel Dmytrenko and I created this website to write about topics I spend time on. These includes Python programming language, Mathematics, Telecommunications and maybe Science Fiction. It helps me to better organize and comprehend ideas and concepts I'm thinking about. If someone finds it interesting or helpful it will be great!
